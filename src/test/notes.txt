class 1 -

after creating a maven project and added all the dependencies
now we are going to write gherkin test case in cucumber project

every single test case will be considered as one scenario

-- we write scenario in feature file in cucumber

creating features directory under resources to keep all feature files

how to create feature file
right click - file - name of file - test.feature (.feature is the extension)


US-12345
Perform login

class 2 -
recap - cucumber/gherkin/BDD

we write such things in feature file where every test case will be considered as scenario

framework -
build management tool - maven
programming language - java
tool - selenium & cucumber

main - for writing the development code
test - for writing the testing code

technical - java
non technical - resources

US - perform login

Feature: This is the name of my user story
Scenario: This is the name of my test case
Tags- Given, When, And, Then

rules -
never add even a small character or . in your step in feature file after step def
otherwise it will not find the exact linking of the step def

never create duplicate step def for the steps otherwise it will confuse and will
throw an exception

login.feature
Given I am launching the application

add employee.feature
Given I am launching the application

User story - searching an employee in HRMS application

US 121 - search employee by id




US 122 - search employee by name

Class 3 -

recap -
    one user story, we need one feature file
    these scenarios are linked with the step definitions

    we have to write the code/script in the step definition itself

    test runner -
    we use junit-cucumber to run our tests
    cucumber options to provide multiple customizable options

    features - path to all the feature files
    glue - to provide the path of step def package
    dry run - to generate missing step def, when we set it to true, it will generate
    all the step def
    tags - to execute scenarios of our choice, we can use different tags in scenarios

    we use OR keyword in tags to execute either scenario A or scenario B
    (ScenarioA or ScenarioB)
    we use AND keyword in tags to execute the scenario having both conditions true
    (scenarioA and scenarioB), only the test case having both tags will be executed


    login scenario -
        admin login
        ess login
        invalid login
